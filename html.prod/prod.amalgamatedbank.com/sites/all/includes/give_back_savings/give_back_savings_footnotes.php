Information and interactive calculators are made available to you as self-help tools for your independent use.

The information shown is designed to provide basic information about the amount of interest you may earn and the amount of money that Amalgamated Bank may donate to the organization you designate at account opening.

	<p>* <strong>Special Rules for Give-Back Savings accounts</strong> &ndash; When you open your Give-Back Savings account, you designate the Participating Organization to which you want the Bank to contribute. In addition to the interest paid to you, the Bank will make a contribution to that Organization following the end of each month. The amount of the contribution will be equal to one-half of the total interest paid to your Give-Back Savings account during that month.</p>

	<p>This contribution is paid directly to the Participating Organization by the Bank, at no cost to you, and is not part of the APY for your account. As the Give-Back contribution is made by the Bank, there may be no tax implications to you. Consult your tax advisor with any questions. There is no substitute for this contribution, and you cannot opt to receive it directly.</p>

	<p>If you close your Give-Back Savings account, the Participating Organization will no longer receive a contribution based on your balance. If the Bank terminates its agreement with the Organization, we will no longer make a contribution to that Organization based on your balance. You may not designate a different Participating Organization, nor stop Bank contributions to the current Participating Organization, unless you close your Give-Back Savings account and open a new account.</p>

	<p>This is a variable rate account. The rates may change after the account is opened. Fees may reduce earnings. Advertised rate and APY are offered at the bank's discretion and may change daily.</p>
	
	<p>This account can only be opened online. It cannot be opened at an Amalgamated Bank branch.</p>  
	
	<p>All accounts are subject to the Bank's terms and conditions.</p>
