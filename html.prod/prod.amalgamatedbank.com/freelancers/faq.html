                        <li><div id="showmenu">What are the benefits of joining the Freelancers Retirement Plan as a freelancer?</div>
                    <div class="menu" style="display: none;">It is similar to joining an employer 401(k) plan: quick enrollment, streamlined administration, vetted investments, and potentially higher annual contributions. Our plan is also flexible so you can contribute whatever you want whenever you want, which is a good thing for unpredictable freelance income. Plus, there are no monthly administrative fees. To make it easy, you can opt for automatic monthly contributions from your bank account or contribution by check.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu2">Who is eligible for the Freelancers Retirement Plan?</div>
                    <div class="menu2" style="display: none;">Members of Freelancers Union who receive 1099 income or who pay themselves as W2 employees, and who are not contributing to another ERISA-qualified retirement account (such as a SEP IRA) are eligible.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu3">Who are you partnering with to offer this plan?</div>
                    <div class="menu3" style="display: none;">We are partnering with New York State-chartered Amalgamated Bank to provide our members with an affordable, flexible, and easy way to save for a more financially secure future. We like Amalgamated Bank because they align with our values and are a majority union-owned and unionized bank dedicated to serving workers. They also offer high quality lower cost funds.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu4">As a freelancer, I often have temporary cash flow needs. Can I withdraw money from this plan in those instances?</div>
                    <div class="menu4" style="display: none;">The Freelancers Retirement Plan includes a loan feature, which is collateralized by your account. While withdrawals are not encouraged, they are permissible but subject to taxation.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu5">How do I contribute to my plan?</div>
                    <div class="menu5" style="display: none;">There are two convenient ways to save. When you enroll, you may take advantage of automatic monthly savings, one-time contributions, or a combination — it’s your choice. When you elect automatic savings, you will designate a specific dollar amount to be electronically transferred from your bank account and deposited to the plan once a month.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu6">Can I contribute whenever I want?</div>
                    <div class="menu6" style="display: none;">Yes. Whether you set up automatic monthly contributions or not, you always have the option to make a non-recurring contribution.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu7">How much can I contribute to my plan?</div>
                    <div class="menu7" style="display: none;">If you pay yourself a regular salary, you may defer up to $17,500 annually on a pre-tax basis; if you are 50 years of age or older, you may also defer an additional $5,500 “catch-up” contribution. In addition, as a self-employed individual, you may also make matching and/or profit-sharing contributions which, when combined with salary deferrals, total up to $52,500 or 100% of eligible compensation, whichever is less.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu8">How do I change my investment elections or contribution amount?</div>
                    <div class="menu8" style="display: none;">You may change investment elections and contribution amounts online at <a href="http://www.frp.amalgamatedbank.com">www.frp.amalgamatedbank.com</a>.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu9">How do rollover contributions work?</div>
                    <div class="menu9" style="display: none;">After you enroll in the Freelancers Retirement Plan, you can elect to rollover any existing qualified retirement plan assets (403(b), 401(k), 457 plans, IRAs, etc.) into the plan. By doing so, you combine your retirement savings in one place and your account can continue to grow tax-deferred. When you elect a rollover, you decide how your rollover account balance will be invested in the new plan’s investment options.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu10">What is the difference between 401(k), SEP, traditional IRA, and Roth IRA accounts for freelancers?</div>
                    <div class="menu10" style="display: none;">An SEP IRA is a form of employer-provided retirement plan, which typically allows small employers to provide a tax-deferred account program to employees. A traditional IRA invests pre-tax dollars, investment earnings accumulate without taxation, and qualified distributions (generally in retirement) are deemed taxable income. A Roth IRA invests after-tax dollars; investment returns accumulate tax-free, and qualified distributions are not subject to federal taxation.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu11">What are some of the Freelancers Retirement Plan’s tax advantages?</div>
                    <div class="menu11" style="display: none;">The federal government (and most states) doesn’t tax your 401(k) before-tax and profit-sharing contributions to the plan because that money comes "off the top" of your total earnings. Here’s an example of how it works.<br /><br />
                    Suppose you earn $30,000 a year &mdash; or $7,500 per calendar quarter &mdash; and set aside $300 a month in 401(k) before-tax contributions into the plan, or $900 each calendar quarter. Your savings are deposited into your Retirement Plan account before income taxes are calculated, so the amount of taxable wages you would enter on your Form 941 Quarterly Federal Tax Return isn’t $7,500 anymore &mdash; it’s $6,600. You put this lower amount on your tax return... so when you get to the bottom line, you pay less in taxes.<br /><br />
                    All the money in your account &mdash; your savings and any investment earnings &mdash; is tax-deferred as long as it stays in the plan. This means you postpone paying income taxes on this money until it’s paid out.<br /><br />
                    If you make Roth contributions, the tax advantages are different. Instead of subtracting the amount you contribute now from your taxable income, you can receive your withdrawals when you retire without paying as much in taxes. Investment earnings on your Roth after-tax contributions can be distributed tax-free after age 59½, or if you die or become disabled, as long as your first Roth after-tax contributions have been in your account for at least five years.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu12">Is this plan insured against loss?</div>
                    <div class="menu12" style="display: none;">In general, the investments in the plan face investment risk and may experience loss of principal. Please see literature for the CUNA Mutual Guaranteed Account investment option regarding the nature of its guarantee by CMFG Life. Past performance does not guarantee future results.<br /><br />
                    Assets in the Freelancers Retirement Plan are held “in trust” at Amalgamated Bank and cannot be used for anything, or by anyone, other than the plan and its participants. Assets in the 401(k) plan are not insured by the FDIC.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu13">When can I start receiving payments from my Freelancers Retirement Plan?</div>
                    <div class="menu13" style="display: none;">IRS rules state that plan withdrawals may commence without penalty at 59&frac12; years of age, and if necessary, required minimum distributions must commence at 70&frac12; years of age. Generally, withdrawals prior to age 59&frac12; are subject to 10% withholding and reported as 1099 income. The plan also has a loan feature.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu14">Who can help me choose my investment elections?</div>
                    <div class="menu14" style="display: none;">The decision of which investment options to choose is yours. Resources and tools are provided by the plan, and Freelancers Union expects to host information sessions for members, but neither Amalgamated Bank nor Freelancers Union provides investment advice.<br /><br /></div></li>
                    <li><div id="showmenu15">I have a question about the Freelancers Retirement Plan. Who can I contact?</div>
                    <div class="menu15" style="display: none;">You can call customer service at 1-800-856-9981, option 4. If you already have an account, enter your Plan ID: 8622, 4-digit PIN, and social security number.<br /><br /></div></li>
