                    <h2>Retirement planning: the basics</h2>	
                    <p>How much annual income will you need during your retirement years to support the lifestyle you want? And how can you position your assets to provide that income? That’s the basis of a retirement plan.</p>

                    <p>Of course there are many variables that come into play, such as what you expect from your retirement, when you want to retire, and how long it will last. You don’t want to outlive your money.</p>

                   <p>There are many ways to invest in your future, including 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, and annuities.* As you consider all your options, you may want to hire an investment professional to ensure you select the investment that’s appropriate for your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.</p> 
                    <p>No matter what you want your retirement to be, and no matter how much you can set aside for your future, now is a great time to start. Even a little savings can add up to a lot.</p>
                    <h2>How much will you need to save?</h2>
                    <p>The short answer is you’ll need 60 to 90 percent of your current income. But a more precise answer involves estimating what your annual retirement expenses will be. Here’s a quick way to do it:</p>
                    <ol class="home">
                        <li>Begin with your current expenses</li>
                    <li>Adjust for inflation (approximately 2.5%, based on the average annual rate**)</li> 
                    <li>Adjust for any expenses that may change through the years (i.e., will your mortgage be paid off and lower your expenses? Will health expenses increase?)</li>
                    <li>Separately calculate the gap using your estimated future assets and income — social security, any other retirement plans, a part-time job you expect to have, and other sources of future income. </li>
                    <li>Do your assets fall short of your estimated expenses? If so, the difference should be considered your retirement income goal.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br />
